/// Emits `app://focused` (bool) whenever the app gains or loses the

/// trustworthy on Windows: tao's focus events fire inconsistently, its
/// `is_focused` false-negatives while the WebView2 child holds Win32 focus,
/// and the page's `document.hasFocus()` stays true even minimized. The
/// frontend pauses every animation on this event — a wrong value here means
/// either burning CPU in the background forever or a permanently frozen UI.
/// GetForegroundWindow is the OS's own ground truth. Polled at 1s and only
/// emitted on change; the first iteration always emits, which also fixes the
/// frontend's initial guess when the app starts in the background.
