/**
 * Single source of truth for "is the host window focused". Primary feed:
 * the Rust-side GetForegroundWindow watcher (`app://focused`, see
 * src-tauri/src/focus.rs) — every webview-visible signal proved unreliable
 * on Windows (tao focus events fire inconsistently, isFocused()
 * false-negatives while the WebView2 child holds Win32 focus, and
 * document.hasFocus() stays true even minimized; all verified live).
 * Tauri's own focus events stay wired as a faster secondary signal; the
 * Rust watcher corrects them within a second either way. Every looping
 * animation gates on this — it's what keeps the app at ~0% CPU while it
 * sits in the background, which is most of a VPN app's life.
